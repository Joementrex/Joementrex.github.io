## So I got invited to foobar :

<h3>The odd things</h3>

I was just casually browsing the internet looking for solutions while doing a coding assignment when the website went weird:

At first I thought it was a simple google event going on until I dove deeper.
It turns out that this is a test by google which they use to find new developers.

Honestly I have no clue why I got an invite, I have the programming ability of... well something bad at programming.





Unfortunately university exams are in the way at the moment, but I will get around to starting once I am finished.
